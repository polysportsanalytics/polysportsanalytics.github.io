Welcome to our blog! We are a group of students a Florida Polytechnic University interested in all things analytics. The goal of this blog is to catalog our journey through the wide world of analytics. To facilitate our journey we will make use of sports data with our first foray being baseball data. We chose baseball to be our first adventure for many different reasons, not the least of which was the ease of access to the data. Beyond just the ease of access, we chose baseball because there is a very mature and robust community already involved with the analysis of baseball data. We hope that we can learn from the great resources available to us and eventually we would love to be able to contribute!  
We hope to update this blog regularly as the baseball season progresses. So stay tuned here for more to come!
